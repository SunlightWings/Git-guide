Introduction to Git: A Version Control System
A version control system is a crucial tool for managing changes made to files and directories in a project. It helps track the evolution of a project, allowing multiple contributors to work collaboratively and ensuring that nothing gets 
lost in the process. In this guide, we will focus on Git, a widely used version control system in the data science community.

Strengths of Git
    -Immutable History: Everything saved in Git is never lost. This means you can always trace back and see which results were generated by specific versions of your programs.
    -Conflict Resolution: Git automatically notifies you when your work conflicts with someone else's. While it's not impossible to accidentally overwrite work, Git provides safeguards to minimize such occurrences.
    -Efficient Collaboration: Git enables the synchronization of work done by different individuals on different machines. This scalability makes it an ideal choice for teams of varying sizes.

Understanding Git Repositories
Each Git project consists of two essential components:
    -Files and Directories: These are the actual elements you create and edit directly within your project.
    -Git's Recorded Information: This is the additional data that Git maintains about the history of your project. The combination of these two elements forms what is known as a Git repository.

Git stores all of its extra information in a directory called .git, situated in the root directory of the repository. It is crucial to note that Git expects this information to be organized in a very specific manner.
Therefore, it's advisable to refrain from editing or deleting anything within the .git directory.
